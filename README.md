### Hi there 👋

<p align="center">
  Hi, I am a recent computer science bachelor's graduate 👩🏻‍💻 from San Jose State University with two years of experience in software development. I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented entry-level Software engineer with a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. My proficiency lies in languages such as Python, Java, C++, C, and Javascript. I have a passion for learning and working across new technologies and domains 🎯. I am now actively seeking an opportunity to contribute to a dynamic software development team where I can further enhance my skills in software engineering. Apart from that I also love to travel, workout, reading and go on an advanture.
